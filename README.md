# RAG Chatbot Project

This repository contains two implementations of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot:

1. **RAG Chatbot using Huggingface**: Utilizes Huggingface's transformers library for building the chatbot.
2. **RAG Chatbot using OLLAMA**: Implements the chatbot with OLLAMA's tools and APIs.

Both implementations support document-based question answering by leveraging pre-trained language models and retrieval mechanisms.
